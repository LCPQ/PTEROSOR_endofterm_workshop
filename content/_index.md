## THE WORKSHOP

Electronic structure theory has developed in many directions in recent years and a large number of new emerging methods have been developed to compute accurately excited-state energies and properties at an affordable cost.
Processes related to electronically excited states are central in chemistry, physics, and biology, playing a key role in ubiquitous processes such as photochemistry, catalysis, and solar cell technology. However, defining an effective method that reliably provides accurate excited-state energies in every scenarios remains a major challenge in theoretical chemistry. In this workshop, we aim at discussing novel approaches to obtain excited-state energies and wave functions in molecular systems and solids.
