## The workshop

Processes related to electronically excited states are central in chemistry, physics, and biology, playing a key role in ubiquitous processes such as photochemistry, catalysis, and solar cell technology. However, defining an effective method that reliably provides accurate excited-state energies remains a major challenge in theoretical chemistry. In this workshop, we aim at discussing novel approaches to obtain excited-state energies and wave functions in molecular systems and solids.
